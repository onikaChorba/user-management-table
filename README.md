# 👩‍💻 User Management Table!

This project demonstrates my ability to create a responsive and functional user management table using React, Redux, and TypeScript. The table fetches data from a mock API and implements local filtering for a seamless user experience.

You can interact with the data, search by different fields, and view the table in a clean, well-organized UI that adapts to different screen sizes

## 🛠️ Technologies and Methods Used

### ⛳️ React with Functional Components and Hooks

This project is built with React's functional components along with hooks like useState, useEffect, and useMemo. These hooks helped manage component state, lifecycle events, and performance optimization efficiently.

### 🗂️ Redux for State Management

I used Redux to manage the state of the application. Redux helps ensure that all user data is handled and updated consistently across the app. I chose the Redux Toolkit for more streamlined state management and cleaner code.

### 🔍 Advanced Filtering Implementation

For filtering, I implemented search input fields for each column (name, username, email, and phone). As users type in these fields, the table dynamically updates, showing results that match the search query in real-time.

### 🚀 TypeScript for Type Safety

To ensure type safety across the entire application, I used TypeScript. This helped reduce potential runtime errors and improved the overall reliability of the codebase by enforcing types in components, Redux state, and the API.

### 📱 Responsive and Adaptive Design
The design focuses on clean and responsive layouts. I ensured that the table and form elements adapt well to different screen sizes, making the application accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 🌍 Fetching Data from JSONPlaceholder API
User data is fetched from JSONPlaceholder using their /users endpoint. This data populates the user management table and updates dynamically with filtering functionality.
